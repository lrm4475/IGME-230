# Cabin in the Woods

## I. High Concept
Cabin in the Woods (CiTW) aims to creep out the plaer while having them eager for more. While building up resources slowly over time, the player will be confonted with unexpected obstacles, creatures of the night, and unexpected visitors.

## II. Genre
CiTW is a text-based survival horror game. Although it starts off subtly creepy and maintains a mysterious atmosphere, I would like the game to get gradually darker over time.

## III.Platform
CiTW will be desktop only, as that is within the scope of this class, but I would imagine this to be playable on mobile as well.

## IV.Story
I haven't decided any specifics with "lore", but the story will stat out simple and inconspicuous. The story begins where the player arrives at the cabin they've been left by an aunt they've never met and little to no backstory is given. As you spend more nights in the cabin, you begin to lose touch with reality and become a prisoner within your new home. Once it becomes evident that leaving is no longer an option, things will spiral even more out of control.

## V. Aesthetics

The graphics will be entirely text. There will be no attempt as rendering images through text art. I have thought about incorporating some portions of the game which do have stronger visual aspects, but I'm not sure how or where I could fit it in just yet.

## VI. Gameplay
#### Mechanics
The base game will be managing resources such as water, firewood, and food. After a certain number of nights, events will be triggered which will force the player to make hard moral decisions or decisions which will affect their resources. Im thinking I might introduce characters which will stay involved with the game, or introduce actions which will result in some sort of mini-games.
#### Controls
Players will only need a mouse and keyboard.

## IX. About Me

I really enjoy retro videogames and take inspiration from the simple, effective storytelling that is often present in older videogames.
