# The Behind-The-Scenes Stuff

## My Process

I began this project with four basic sketches of how I wanted my webpages to look at a bare minimum. I gathered all of my information beforehand and saved the appropriate links unter the appropriate folders on the bookmark bar in my browser. I then wrote down everything into a Word document that I'd have to write onto my webpages, so that when it came to making my webpages, I would only have to focus on making my designs look good. Afterwards, I began coding my webpages. I began to add small details I hadn't thought of before and fixed errors I hadn't forseen.

## Meeting Requirements
I believe I have met all the requirements for Project 1. I have validated both my HTML and CSS. I have created the four necessary pages and feel they have a unified design. I have also check to make sure the image and tag requirements have been met, along with other requirements such as the color of links or css specifications. I have checked my writing for grammar and spelling mistakes as well.
