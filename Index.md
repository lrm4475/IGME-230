# Cabin
## A mysterious text adventure..
I am planning my game to be a simple yet mysterious text-based adventure. I am modeling my game after popular web games such as A Dark Room, Candy Box, and Zork.
 I've played many text-based games and find them consistently interesting yet pleasantly simple. My game will be called "Cabin in the Woods" and will be about someone staying in a cabin left to them by a deceased relative. The player will need to manage their resources and deal with unexpected encounters over the course of many nights. As the player spends more nights in the cabin, it will grow more dangerous.
